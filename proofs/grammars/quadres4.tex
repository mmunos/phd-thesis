Assume we have such an algorithm $\cA$. Consider a procedure which receives an unambiguous unannotated CFG $\cG$ and an input string $w$, converts $\cG$ into an annotated grammar $\cG'$ with empty output set. Since $\cG'$ is unambiguous and rigid, we can run $\cA$ over $\cG'$ and $w$. If $w\in L(\cG)$, then $\sem{\cG'}(w) = \{\eps\}$, and if $w\not\in L(\cG)$, then $\sem{\cG'}(w) = \emptyset$. Thus, after the preprocessing phase of $\cA$ we need only to wait a constant amount of time to see if the string $\eps$ is given as output, or none is. We conclude that this procedure solves the problem with the same complexity as the preprocessing phase of $\cA$.
