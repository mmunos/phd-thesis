As it is common in the enumeration algorithms literature~\cite{Bagan06,Courcelle09,Segoufin13}, for our algorithms we assume the computational model of \emph{Random Access Machines} (RAM) with uniform cost measure, and addition and subtraction as basic operations~\cite{AhoHU74}. We assume that a RAM has read-only input registers where the machine places the input, read-write work registers where it does the computation and write-only output registers where it gives the output (i.e., the enumeration of the results).
