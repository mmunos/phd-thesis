In Chapter~\ref{ch2} we presented our formalism of annotated grammars and our results on the efficient enumeration of all annotations of an input string. 
Our results achieve output-linear delay, and cubic-time preprocessing if the grammar is unambiguous, quadratic-time if it is rigid, and linear-time for profiled-deterministic PDAnns.

The main question left open in the chapter is that of the precise complexity of
this task, depending on the grammar formalism. For instance, can we improve the 
$\cO(n^3)$ algorithm to match the complexity of Valiant's parser? For which grammar
classes can we extend the linear-time preprocessing approach? We believe,
however, that an absolute classification is out of reach, given that classifying
the fine-grained complexity of parsing is still open to a large extent even in
the case of unannotated CFGs. 

Given that the enumeration task is at least as difficult as parsing, it would be interesting to know about a tighter lower bound for enumeration in some fragment that is not immediately derivable from the parsing task itself.
