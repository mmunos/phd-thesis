We have presented our enumeration results for annotated grammars and
pushdown annotators. We conclude the chapter by applying them to the
standard context of \emph{document spanners}~\cite{FaginKRV15} and to the
\emph{extraction grammars} recently introduced in~\cite{Peterfreund21}.

\paragraph{Mappings, spanners, extraction grammars}
This chapter studies strings~$s \in \Sigma^*$ with letters
\emph{annotated} by an annotation from a finite set, but document spanners work
with \emph{mappings} selecting so-called \emph{spans} of~$s$. Formally, 
%
a \emph{span} of~$s$ is a pair 
%
$\spanc{i}{j}$ with $1 \leq i \leq j \leq |s|+1$ describing a
possibly empty factor of~$s$.
For a finite set of \emph{variables} $\var$,
%
a \emph{document spanner} (or just \emph{spanner}) is a
function that maps every string $s \in \Sigma^*$ to a set of \emph{mappings},
where a mapping (intuitively denoting an extraction result)
assigns each variable of~$\var$ to a span of~$s$.

%\newcommand{\splain}{\textsf{plain}}

\begin{definition}[Ref-words]
  \label{gram:def:refwords}
For the set of variables $\var$ we define the \emph{variable operations} of $\var$ by
$\captures_\var = \bigcup_{x \in \var} \{ {\vdash_x}, {\dashv_x} \}$.
A \emph{ref-word} is a string over $\Sigma \cup \captures_\var$, and we let
  $\splain: (\Sigma \cup \captures_\var)^* \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ be the morphism
  over ref-words that removes variable operations
A ref-word is {\em valid} if each variable in $\var$ is opened exactly once and then closed exactly once.
A valid ref-word $r$ then defines a mapping~$\eta_r$ over $\splain(r)$ in the following way:
for each variable $x \in \var$, there is a unique factorization $r = r_x^p \cdot \vdash_x \, \cdot \, r_x \, \cdot\, \dashv_x \cdot r_x^s$,
and we set 
$\eta^r(x) \colonequals \spanc{i}{j}$ for $i \colonequals |\splain(r_x^p)|+1$ and $j \colonequals i + |\splain(r_x)|$. 
\end{definition}

Peterfreund~\cite{Peterfreund21} specifies spanners via \emph{extraction
grammars}. An \emph{extraction grammar} is a tuple
$\cH = (V, \Sigma, \var, P, \allowbreak S)$ where 
$V$ is a finite set of \emph{nonterminals},
$\Sigma$ is the alphabet,
$\var$ is a set of variables, 
$P$ is a finite set of production rules of the form $A \to \alpha$ with $A \in
V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma \cup \captures_\var)^*$, and $S \in V$ is the
\emph{start symbol}.
We assume that $V$, $\Sigma$, and $\var$ are pairwise disjoint.
Note the difference with annotated grammars: the annotations must correspond to
variable operations (in order to capture spans), and they are represented as separate terminals
instead of annotating existing terminals, which we believe makes the design of
enumeration algorithms less convenient.

The semantics of extraction grammars is similar to that for annotated grammars.
It is defined through \emph{derivations}. Specifically, the rules $P$ define the
\emph{(left) derivation relation} $\der{\cH} \ \subseteq \, (V \cup \Sigma \cup \captures_\var)^* \times (V \cup \Sigma \cup  \captures_\var)^*$ such that $u A \beta \der{\cH} u \alpha \beta$ iff $u \in (\Sigma \cup \captures_\var)^*$, $A \in V$, $\alpha, \beta \in (V \cup \Sigma \cup \captures_\var)^*$, and $A \rightarrow \alpha \in P$. We denote by $\der{\cH}^*$ the reflexive and transitive closure of $\der{\cH}$. 
Then the \emph{language} defined by $\cH$ is the set of ref-words $L(\cH) = \{w \in (\Sigma \cup \captures_\var)^* \mid S \der{\cH}^* w\}$.
This language defines a \emph{spanner} $\sem{\cH}$ as follows: for every document $d \in \Sigma^*$,
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
  \[
\sem{\cH}(d) \ = \ \{ \, \eta^r \ \mid \ r \in L(\cH), \text{ $r$ is valid}, \text{ and } \splain(r) = d\, \}.
\]
Note that ref-words that are not valid are ignored.
An extraction grammar $\cH$ is called \emph{functional} if every $r \in L(\cH)$ is valid, and it is called \emph{unambiguous} if for every $r \in L(\cH)$ there exists exactly one derivation of~$r$ from~$S$.

Thus, extraction grammars are like annotated grammars but with variable
operations that
describe span endpoints
(whereas our annotations are arbitrary), and that are expressed as separate
variable operation characters (not annotations of existing letters).
%

We can now formally define the \emph{equivalence} between an extraction grammar
and an annotated grammar. To do so, we first explain how we can translate
mappings to annotations:

\begin{definition}[Output associated to a mapping]
  \label{gram:def:outputset}
Given a set $\var$ of variables, the corresponding set of annotations $\Omega_\var$ will be the powerset of $\captures_\var$.
Now, given a mapping~$\eta$ on a document~$d$ and variables~$\var$ to an annotation, we 
%
%
let $\cI = \bigcup_{x \in \var} \{i, j \mid \eta(x) = \spanc{i}{j}\}$ be the
set of indices which appear in some span of $\eta$.
Further, for each $k \in \cI$, let $S_k = \{\vdash_x \mid \exists j. \, \eta(x) = \spanc{k}{j}\} \cup \{\dashv_x \, \mid \exists i. \, \eta(x) = \spanc{i}{k}\}$. We now define the output $\outf(\eta) = (i_1,S_{i_1})\ldots(i_m,S_{i_m})$ where $\cI = \{i_1,\ldots,i_m\}$ and  $i_1 < \cdots < i_m$, namely, we group the captures for each position as a set and use this set as the annotation.
Note that the largest index that appears in the annotation can be $|d|+1$ because of the range of spans.
\end{definition}

% We can now define \emph{equivalence} between extraction grammars and annotation
% grammars:

% \begin{definition}[Equivalent annotated grammar]
%   \label{gram:def:equivalentannotated}
  
% \end{definition}


\paragraph{Comparing both formalisms}
Given an extraction grammar $\cH$ on alphabet $\Sigma$ and with variables
$\var$, we say that it 
has an \emph{equivalent annotated grammar} $\cG$ if $\cG$ is over the 
set of annotations $\Omega_\var$ and over the
alphabet $\Sigma \cup \{\#\}$
for $\#$ a fresh symbol, and
if for every document $d \in \Sigma^*$ and every mapping $\eta$ of~$d$ over~$\var$, we have
$\eta \in \sem{\cH}(d)$ iff $\outf(\eta) \in \sem{\cG}(d\cdot \#)$.
%
The $\#$-symbol at the end is used because of the difference in the indexing of spans (from $1$ to $|d|+1$) and annotations (from 1 to~$d$).
%

We show that every extraction grammar has an equivalent annotation grammar
in this sense, and the translation further preserves unambiguity:

%

\begin{proposition}\label{gram:prop:extrac-grammars-general}
  Given any extraction grammar $\cH$ with $k$ variables, we can build an
  equivalent annotated grammar $\cG$ in time $\cO(9^{3k}\cdot|\cH|^2)$. Moreover, if $\cH$ is unambiguous then so is $\cG$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \input{./proofs/grammars/extract2annotated.tex}
\end{proof}

Hence, our formalism of annotated grammars captures that of extraction grammars.
%
Unfortunately, the translation is exponential, 
intuitively because $\Omega$ must cover all possible sets of variable operations.
We note that, in exchange for this, annotated grammars
are strictly more \emph{expressive}: each output can annotate an arbitrary
number of positions in the string (e.g., every other character), unlike
extraction grammars whose mappings have a fixed number of variables.

We complete Proposition~\ref{gram:prop:extrac-grammars-general} to give more
intuition about the conciseness of extraction grammars vs annotated grammars,
and the difference in expressiveness.

We first give a simple example to show that, with our notion of equivalence,
we may indeed need an exponential number of symbols in the annotation set, implying that extraction grammars are in some cases exponentially more concise:

%
\begin{example}
Consider the following functional extraction grammar $\cH$ with $n$ variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ and alphabet $\{a\}$:
  \[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
	\cH: & A_1 & \rightarrow &  \vdash_{x_1} \dashv_{x_1} A_2 \ \ \mid \ \ \vdash_{x_1} A_2 \dashv_{x_1} \\
	&  A_2 & \rightarrow &  \vdash_{x_2} \dashv_{x_2} A_3 \ \ \mid \ \ \vdash_{x_2} A_3 \dashv_{x_2} \\
	&  & \vdots & \\
	&  A_{n} & \rightarrow &  \vdash_{x_n} \dashv_{x_n} a \ \ \mid  \ \ \vdash_{x_n} a \dashv_{x_n} \\
\end{array}
\]
For the document $a$, this extraction grammar will output all possible combinations depending on whether $\dashv_{x_i}$ is at the beginning or end of $a$ for each $i \leq n$. Thus, an equivalent annotated grammar will need to consider all possible subsets of $\{ {\dashv_x} \mid x\in \var\}$ as possible annotations of the character~$a$, which will require an exponential number of rules.
  %
  %
\end{example}

We then illustrate why annotated grammars are in fact \emph{strictly} more
expressive: in addition to capturing all extraction grammars
(Proposition~\ref{gram:prop:extrac-grammars-general}),
annotated grammars can express functions that do not correspond to an annotation grammar.

%
\begin{example}
  Consider a singleton annotation set $\Omega = \{\oout\}$, a singleton alphabet $\Sigma = \{a\}$, and the annotated grammar with start symbol $S$ and production $S \rightarrow a (a, \oout) S | a | \epsilon$. For each string of $\Sigma^*$, it produces one output where every other character is annotated. This cannot be expressed by an extraction grammar, as such a grammar fixes a finite set $\var$ of variables independently from the input document, and each variable is mapped to only one span.
\end{example}


\paragraph{Enumeration for extraction grammars}
As extraction grammars can be rewritten to annotated grammars in an unambiguity-preserving way (Proposition~\ref{gram:prop:extrac-grammars-general}), we can derive from
Theorem~\ref{gram:thm:cubic} an enumeration result for unambiguous extraction grammars with cubic preprocessing time in data complexity.

\begin{theorem}
  Given an unambiguous extraction grammar $\cH$ with $k$ variables and a string $s$, we can
  enumerate the mappings of~$\sem{\cH}(s)$ with preprocessing time 
  $\cO(9^{3k} \cdot |\cH|^2 \cdot |s|^3)$ (hence, cubic in~$|s|$), and with output-linear delay
  (independent from~$s$, $k$, or~$\cH$).
	%
\end{theorem}

%
%

In data complexity, this improves over the result of~\cite{Peterfreund21}
%
%
%
for unambiguous extraction grammars, whose preprocessing time is
$\cO(9^{2k} \cdot |\cH|^2 \cdot |s|^5)$, i.e.,
%
%
our data complexity is cubic instead of quintic.
%
%
%
%
We leave to future work a study of enumeration results for
restricted classes of extraction grammars via %
Theorems~\ref{gram:thm:cubic} and~\ref{gram:thm:quadratic}.
