We cannot show a lower bound that matches the complexity of our algorithm, but
we can prove that we cannot achieve a preprocessing time better than the time to
test whether a string is accepted by a CFG, which is essentially
the complexity of Boolean matrix multiplication~\cite{AbboudBW18}:

%

\begin{proposition}
  \label{gram:prp:cubiclowerbound}
  Let $\omega$ be the
  %
  smallest value
  such that we can multiply two Boolean $n\times
  n$ matrices in time $\cO(n^{\omega+o(1)})$. Then for any $c>0$ there is an unambiguous
  annotated grammar $\cG$ such that, given an input string~$w$, enumerating 
  $\sem{\cG}(w)$ with output-linear delay requires a preprocessing time of
  $\Omega(|w|^{\omega-c})$.
\end{proposition}
