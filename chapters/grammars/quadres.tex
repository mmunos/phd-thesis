In the previous section, we have shown how to enumerate the output of
unambiguous annotated grammars on strings, with output-linear delay and cubic
preprocessing in the input string. This algorithm has two drawbacks: it requires
us to impose that the grammar is unambiguous, and the cubic preprocessing 
%
may be expensive.

In this section, we introduce a new class of annotated grammars, called
\emph{rigid grammars}. Rigid grammars do not need to be
unambiguous, but as we will show a rigid grammar can always be converted to
additionally impose unambiguity. The point of rigid grammars is that we can show
a quadratic bound on Algorithm~\ref{gram:alg:cubic} for them.

We first define rigid grammars in this section. We then state that we can impose
unambiguity for rigid grammars, and derive some consequences about their
expressiveness and the complexity of recognizing
them. Last, we show a quadratic bound on the
preprocessing time for output-linear enumeration for such grammars, and explain
why a better bound would be challenging to achieve.
