We now turn to the question of whether the quadratic preprocessing time for
rigid grammars is optimal. For this, we notice that the parsing of
(unannotated) unambiguous grammars can be performed in quadratic time, but the
question of finding a better algorithm was open as of
2012~\cite{schmitz2012can}. Now, this is a special case of our problem, because
an unannotated unambiguous grammar is in particular a rigid and unambiguous
annotated grammar, and enumerating the outputs of an unannotated grammar just
means deciding in constant time after the preprocessing whether the input
unannotated string is accepted or not. Thus:

\begin{proposition}\label{gram:prp:redunann}
  Any algorithm to enumerate the accepted outputs of a rigid
  annotated grammar can be used to test if an input string is accepted by an
  unambiguous unannotated grammar, with same complexity as that of the
  preprocessing phase.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \input{./proofs/grammars/quadres4.tex}
\end{proof}

For this reason, we leave open the question of whether a better than quadratic
preprocessing time can be achieved in this case.
