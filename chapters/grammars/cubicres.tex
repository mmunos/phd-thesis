In this section we start presenting our results and show a first
algorithm to enumerate the outputs of an annotated grammar on an input string.
%
%
%
The algorithm applies to any unambiguous annotated grammar, and ensures cubic-time preprocessing and
output-linear delay in data complexity; in terms of combined complexity, the
preprocessing is linear on the grammar.
%
%
This improves the result by
Peterfreund~\cite{Peterfreund21}, which had quintic-time preprocessing in data complexity.

The section is structured as follows.
We present a general-purpose enumeration data structure called
\emph{enumerable sets}, which is the basis of 
our enumeration algorithms. 
We then introduce the \emph{arity-two normal form} for annotated grammars,
designed to ensure efficient enumeration, and which can be
enforced in linear time.
After this, we present
our algorithm and state the main result in this chapter (Theorem~\ref{gram:thm:cubic}).
Last, we state a conditional
data complexity lower bound.
