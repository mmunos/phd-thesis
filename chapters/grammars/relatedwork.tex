We have explained how our work is set in the context of document spanners~\cite{FaginKRV15}, and in particular of enumeration results for regular spanners~\cite{FlorenzanoRUVV18,amarilli2019constant}. A recent survey of much of this literature can be found in Peterfreund's PhD thesis~\cite{peterfreund2019complexity}. The most related work to ours is the more recent introduction of extraction grammars by Peterfreund~\cite{Peterfreund21}, which we already discussed.
%Another related work is~\cite{icdt2020nested}, by some authors of the present
%paper. 
%This paper studies enumeration for spanners over nested documents,
%defined as visibly pushdown transducers.

There are also some other extensions of regular spanners that are reminiscent of CFGs, e.g., core spanners (featuring equality) or generalized core spanners (with difference) already introduced in~\cite{FaginKRV15}, or Datalog evaluated over regular spanners as in~\cite{peterfreund2019recursive}. However, to our knowledge, there are no known constant-delay enumeration algorithms in these contexts.

Our study of enumeration for annotated grammars is also reminiscent of
enumeration results for queries over trees expressed as tree automata. An
algorithm for this was given by Bagan~\cite{bagan2006mso} with linear-time
preprocessing and constant-delay in data complexity, for deterministic tree
automata, and this was extended in~\cite{amarilli2019enumeration} to
nondeterministic automata. However, this is again more restricted:
evaluating a tree automaton on a tree amounts to evaluating a \emph{visibly
	pushdown} automaton over a string representation of the tree, which is again
more restrictive than general context-free grammars.
